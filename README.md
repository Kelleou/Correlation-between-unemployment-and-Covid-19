# Correlation-between-unemployment-and-Covid-19
CSC110 Final Project where we analyzed how factors like age, gender, education
and field of job impact unemployment of different individuals.

**Instructions:**
1. Download the required libraries in the ’requirements.txt’ file: In our program, we have used:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (this is the required library to use pandas to plot our bar graphs)
2. Download the datasets. Make sure to place them in the same folder as the Python files.
3. After running main.py, the user will be prompted for the appropriate input for industry, age, gender,and education
level. These values will serve as input values for the function ’probability industry and demographics’. There are
comments which list the possible inputs, which must be input with correct spelling and capitalization and must not
be put in quotation marks when being input.
4. After inputting a set of appropriate values, the user should be able to see a total of four graphs visualizing
our results, some of which appear after others have been closed, along with a string output in the python console
which explains different probabilities related to the user’s chosen demographics.
